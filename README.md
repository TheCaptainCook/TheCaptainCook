- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheCaptainCook aka Masem Mandal
- 👀 I’m interested in anything and everything my brain can soak on to. But Importantly don't make it long as encyclopedia (with no pictures).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Minecraft Plugin Development and persuing Master's in Information Security and Cyber Forensics.
- 🌱 Why Minecraft Plugin Development you may ask? - Because with minecraft being sandbox type game, I can run my imagination wild. So, I decided to build my own  mincraft mods and when I have finished my ideas then decided to maintain the abandoned mods and revieve to the newest version of the Minecraft.
- 🏄‍♂️ What do i do in my free time, you wanna know? - You can either find me debugging mistake or I have been discovering new ways to make mistakes. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some Minecraft Mods, Server Hosting, Web Hosting, VPS Service, WordPress, basic website security, Malware research, DNS Services or domain services. 
- 📫 Thinking of Colaboration? - Wanna Reach me - Masem@duck.com - (I will answer probably if I have not busted my head in frustration of debugging of new project.)

Life's motto - "Make Mistakes - Debug later on. Since you can't get far with a error light (🔴) on".
