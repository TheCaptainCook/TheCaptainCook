- 👋 Hi, I’m @mac2k17 aka Masem Mandal
- 👀 I’m interested in everyting my brain can soak on to
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Netbeans
- 🌱 Why Netbeans you many ask? - Because I am frustrated at all other web pannels finiky behaviour, so I decided to build my own (not totally true though, Just forked a dead project (Zpannel) in hopes to revive it and use it on my own VPS to have some stability and less resource hungry(A man can only hope so much, Isn't it?))
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, I don't know or am I not ready, you will never know.
- 📫 Wanna Reach me - MasemMandal@pm.me - (I will answer probably if I have not busted my head in frustration of new project.)
