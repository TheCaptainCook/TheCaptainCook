- 👋 Hi, I’m @mac2k17 aka Masem Mandal
- 👀 I’m interested in everyting my brain can soak on to
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Minecraft Plugin Development
- 🌱 Why Minecraft Plugin Development you many ask? - Because I am loving minecraft being sandbox, so I decided to build my own  mincraft mods and decided to mentain the abandoned mods and revieve to the newest version of the Minecraft.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, I don't know or am I not ready, you will never know.
- 📫 Wanna Reach me - MasemMandal@pm.me - (I will answer probably if I have not busted my head in frustration of new project.)
